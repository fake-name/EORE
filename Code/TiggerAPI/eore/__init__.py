'''

The EORE system RF control boards provide a single, unified API that allows
configuring of all the hardware functionalities.

Functionally, the entire interface is available through the single class
``EoreController()``, which provides control methods for the various hardware
sections.

Fundamentally, the multiple, functionally disparate component types.
Currently, it has variable attenuators, RF switches, RF Oscillators of several
some varieties, and auxiliary systems (such as thermal stabilization).


Mapping between switch-port/switch/attenuator/oscillator numbers and the
actual hardware is provided by a set of constant variables defined in the
``eore`` module.
